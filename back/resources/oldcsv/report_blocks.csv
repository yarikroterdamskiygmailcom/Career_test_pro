Page 3, section 7	40	Introduction	
Page 3, section 8	41	In this report an analysis is made of your personality profile and the professions that will fit this profile based on the career test questionnaire you just made on Careertestpro.com.	
Page 3, section 9	42	The career test that you took is based on the RIASEC Theory of Dr.John Holland. His philosophy is at the root of many other career tests that are used worldwide. This theory is also the most influential in its field on which more than 500 scientific studies are based.	
Page 3, section 10	43	The RIASEC theory is based on 6 different personality characteristics, being:	
Page 3, section 11	44	Doers	
Page 3, section 12	45	Thinkers	
Page 3, section 13	46	Creators	
Page 3, section 14	47	Helpers	
Page 3, section 15	48	Persuaders	
Page 3, section 16	49	Organizers	
Page 3, section 17	50	These 6 personality characteristics will be discussed in depth later on in this report, so you get to know in detail what they stand for. It is often the case that there are multiple personality types that fit one person. Everyone has something of all of these characteristic features in their personality.	
Page 3, section 18	51	The method used by Careertestpro is based on a combination of a main personality type and two personality subtypes, that also apply to you. The main personality type and the two subtypes are displayed in a three-letter code. This could for instance be RAE as a three-lettercode, meaning a Realistic main personality type with subtypes Artistic and Enterprising. These 6 personality characteristics will be discussed in depth later on in this report, so you get to know in detail what they stand for. It is often the case that there are multiple personality types that fit one person. Everyone has something of all of these characteristic features in their personality.	
Page 4, section 1	52	The method used by Careertestpro is based on a combination of a main personality type and two personality subtypes, that also apply to you. The main personality type and the two subtypes are displayed in a three-letter code. This could for instance be RAE as a three-lettercode, meaning a Realistic main personality type with subtypes Artistic and Enterprising.	
Page 4, section 2	53	The better this three-letter code matches three-letter code for a particular profession, the greater chance that you will find success and happiness within this profession. However, one should also take into account the fact that people themselves influence their professional environment, which means they can also find satisfaction in a profession that appealed less to them initially. It is therefore wise to also review and analyze professional occupations that may not directly match your personal three-letter code but have similarities and personal characteristics in common.	
Page 4, section 3	54	This is why at the end of this report, you will find all possible combinations of your three-letter code to make sure you get a glance at other occupations that might also fit your personality. The composition of your profile is based on a number of factors that have been approached from different perspectives during the questionnaire you filled in.	
Page 4, section 4	55	Through analyzing the activities that appeal to you, your personal behavior, work values and skillset, the personality profile in this report has been created.	
Page 4, section 5	56	On the next pages in this report your scores are displayed. Furthermore, the different personality types will be discussed in detail.

Page 15, section 1	73	Total Score	
Page 15, section 2	74	Based on your scores shown in the graph, your personal three-letter code is:	
Page 15, section 3	75	Main Personality	
Page 15, section 4	76	Sub Personality 1	
Page 15, section 5	77	Sub Personality 2	
Page 16, section 1	78	In the score graph above you can see a pattern. There are several possible conclusions to be drawn based on this pattern graph.	
Page 16, section 2	79	If the graph shows no strong peaks or low points, but is somewhat flatter in shape, it could mean that you may have no strong interests or skills in a particular area in the RIASEC personality type inventory.	
Page 16, section 3	80	If you have a very flat profile this could be due to several causes. A flat profile sometimes occurs if someone answers the questionnaire’s questions too quickly without really wondering where their abilities, skills and interest lie or what things are really important for them in a professional environment.	
Page 16, section 4	81	What also may underlie a flat profile is the fact that young and/or inexperienced people have not yet fully developed their personalities. So if the trend line shows a low score, this may indicate that there is not yet a fully developed view of their own identity. However, this does not have to be the case necessarily.	
Page 16, section 5	82	A flat profile could also indicate that you have a stable personality, showing different skills and interests. This is especially the case if there is a high, flattened line shown in the total score graph.	
Page 16, section 6	83	Should all above not apply to you and your graph shows clear peaks in the trend line, this indicates a clear focus on your interests and skills. It is also possible that you will see several peaks in the graph, this indicates that your interests lie in multiple personality types. Based on your scores shown in the graph, your personal three-letter code is:	
Page 16, section 7	84	Three-letter code is based on the three personality types that are most applicable to you. It could occur that you have just as high a score on 2 of 3, or 3 of 3 letters. When this is the case, the order of the letters in the three-letter code does not matter and therefore it can be concluded that each sequence of the three-letter code applies to you in the same amount.	
Page 16, section 8	85	On the next pages the personality types of your three-letter code are described in more detail.

Page 23, section 1	162	Occupation List Highest Scored Personality Type	
Page 23, section 2	163	On the next page a list of occupations is shown based on your highest score and the main personality type	
Page 23, section 3	164	These occupations probably appeal to you and in first instance solely based on your highest score on a specific personality type. This means that your two subtypes have not yet been taken into account.	
Page 23, section 4	165	These subtypes in combination with your main personality type, together your personal three-letter code, are discussed further on in this report. This is done for a specific reason. Occupations solely in your highest score category might not fit your subtypes, causing it not to be mentioned in your specific occupation list (based on your personal three-letter code) even though you just might like it.	
Page 23, section 5	166	The occupation list on the next page consist of typical occupations which could belong to your main personality type. You can check it and find out which of the occupations or industries suits you.

Page 25, section 1	196	Three-Letter Code Occupations	
Page 25, section 2	197	The occupation list on the next page is based on your personal three-letter code that’s reflects the results of the career test you have made on Careertestpro.com. This code will help you to find occupations that match the composition of your personality as detailed as possible.	
Page 25, section 3	198	The database of Careertestpro.com consists of more than 3,000 occupations. All these occupations are classified according to their corresponding three-letter code	
Page 25, section 4	199	On the next page of this report you will find occupations that are aligned with your personal three-letter code, that was extracted from the questionnaire you filled in.	
Page 25, section 5	200	The first three-letter code that you will see on the list of occupations is the one that exactly fitted your personality. Subsequently other occupations are listed who have the same three letters in their code, but in a different order. These occupations are important because it may well be the case that these have similarities with your exact three-letter code and thus might appeal to you.	
Page 25, section 6	201	It’s up to you to get inspiration, ideas and motivation from the occupations list below and to examine the ones that appeal to you the most.	
Page 25, section 7	202	Next to the occupations you will find an educational level that indicates on how much education people need to do the work, how much related experience people need to do the work and how much on-the-job training people need to do the work.

Page 30, section 1	209	Conclusion	
Page 30, section 2	210	Based on the six different personality types, this report has given you insight into your personality profile. To each personality profile certain occupations and activities fit to a greater or lesser extent. This is why career tests in general are not actually tests that give a specific answer to the question: what should I be?	
Page 30, section 3	211	Instead the career test and the resulting personality profile provide a substantiation why certain occupations suit you better than others. These test results can help you make better decisions with regard to your (future) career. The occupations on the specific occupation list based on your personality profile are examples of stereotypical occupations associated with the different personality types.	
Page 30, section 4	212	However, the reality is that in practice, the boundaries between different personality types and three-letter codes are blurred and many occupations actually fit multiple personality types. For example, a surgeon must be able to communicate with people (social personality type), he/she must have an academic background (investigative personality type), like diversity in his/her work environment and needs to know how to operate medical equipment (realistic personality type). This example show that multiple personality types are present in one occupation.	
Page 30, section 5	213	It is important for you to determine for yourself which of your characteristics, qualities and skills connect to the work areas that you want to be active in. If you are for instance a person who likes to work outside you should not look for work environments in which you work behind a desk all day on a computer. If you are an artistic person then it is advisable to choose an occupation in which personal interpretation, originality and creativity are encouraged and are appreciated.	
Page 30, section 6	214	Furthermore, it can be done in different ways and does not necessarily have to be in an obvious work environment for a creative person like occupations as a writer or actor. Coming up with a new advertising campaign or a new product also requires a lot of creative insight and imagination.	
Page 30, section 7	215	What you should also keep in consideration is the fact that a lot of people do not find all the characteristics, qualities and competencies that they find important in their work environment. For you it is important that you know who you are and know what you like.	
Page 30, section 8	216	Also, you need to figure out where your personal skills, qualities and competencies come into their own. By doing so you can reflect on you work and make the adjustments in your career that you think you should make. This will help you to identify the tasks in your work that fit your personality best and also identify the ones which do not.	
Page 30, section 9	217	Provided that the work environment allows these kind of adjustments, you can create a professional work environment in which your core competences and skills come into their own within your occupational activities.	
Page 31, section 1	218	What’s next?	
Page 31, section 2	219	It is wise to discuss your test results with family, friends and colleagues in order to validate them. By doing so you can find out what they think about what type of person you are and how they look at your talents, skills and competences.	
Page 31, section 3	220	You can translate these findings back, in combination with your own competence assessment, to occupations that appeal to you and in which you think your competences come into their own the most. Keep in mind, as discussed earlier, it often happens that not all of your personality traits are reflected in a specific occupation.	
Page 31, section 4	221	However, you can make a shortlist of occupations that appeal to you and select one of those to start your career in. When you find the occupation or career field that you want to start your career in you should gather more information about the required background, skills and/or educational level.	
Page 31, section 5	222	What does a regular day on the job looks like in this occupation? Or what tasks do they regularly perform? Answering questions like these will give you more insight in that specific occupation. Furthermore, this type of information is easy to find on the internet and will help you in making your career choices.
