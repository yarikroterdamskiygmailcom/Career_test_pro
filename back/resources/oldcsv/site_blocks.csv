Page faq, section 1	43	Frequently Asked Questions
Page faq, section 2	44	We are always happy to help you!
Page faq, section 3	45	Which method does CareertestPro use?
Page faq, section 4	46	CareertestPro is based on the theory of the Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes (RIASEC). This theoretical framework was developed by J.L. Holland and refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice based upon personality types. Each letter of the RIASEC code stands for a particular personality type, being: Realistic personality type (Doers); Investigative personality type (Thinkers); Artistic personality type (Creators); Social personality type (Helpers); Enterprising personality type (Persuaders); Conventional personality type (Organizers). All RIASEC Personality types are discussed separately with regard to your personal score on skills, (work) values, activities, personal behavior and professions. The RIASEC method is one of the most extensively researched and used test in personality psychology. The theory assumes that everyone has an inner predisposition for certain professions. By means of six different personality characteristics, which are described above, your unique personality profile is comprised. Due to the fact that each person is unique, everyone will generate a different personality profile. The career test on CareertestPro creates a personalized three-lettercode, based on 3 of the 6 RIASEC personality types. This three-letter code is based on a primary personality type, a secondary personality type and a tertiary personality type. Obviously, the primary personality type is the one you high-scored. The secondary is your second score, and self-evident, the tertiary your third.
